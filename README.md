Have you ever seen those PC servers with the PlotMe or PlotSquared plugin, and you thought "Hey, why can't I have plots on my MCPE server?" Well, now you can with **MyPlot** for PocketMine-MP! It's easy to set up, and simple to use! *NOTE:* MyPlot only supports PMMP issues. Other server softwares may not be compatible!
